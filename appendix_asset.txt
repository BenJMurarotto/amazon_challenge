Product Description: <p><b>Organic Corn: A Staple Food of Americans</b><p>Corn, also known as maize, is a food every US resident comes to love from childhood. The Native Americans have been eating this grain for millennia and the arrival of Spanish conquistadores spread this incredible plant all over the world. Today, corn is one of the most important foods in the world. Many programs aiming to fight world hunger rely on this particular plant due to the ease of its cultivation and high nutritional value.<p>Food To Live Organic Corn allows you to enjoy this delicious and healthy grain anytime. You can buy it in bulk and it will safely wait in your pantry until you feel like cooking some corn dish. This is a desire that one should encourage, as organic corn is a very good cooking ingredient. It contains quite a lot of nutrients as well as dietary fiber and protein.<p>Corn is used in many industries, including pharmaceuticals where corn starch is one of the most common additives. A single bushel of sweet corn can be turned into 32 pounds of starch or 33 pounds of sweetener. It can also be used to create 2.5 gallons of ethanol fuel.<p><b>Food To Live Organic Corn: Non-GMO and 100% Safe</b><p>Food To Live Organic Corn comes from farmers who use only the best agricultural practices to ensure the health of both their produce and the land. Our Certified Organic Corn is indeed organic. This means that it’s a non-GMO product that doesn’t contain any dangerous and toxic chemicals that might come from pesticides, nitrate fertilizers, and other chemicals used in some farms.<p>Most importantly, Food To Live Organic Corn is free from any dangerous genetic modifications. It’s a sad fact that the people of today have to be concerned about this matter in particular as the majority of corn in the US used to be GMO.
